Hello! I am a computer science new graduate and have a bachelors in Computer Science and minor in Urban Studies from Loyola Marymount University. I just finished a 3-month long internship at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) working on sustainable technologies and learned a lot about the industry! Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant to [Dr. Toal](https://cse.lmu.edu/department/computerscience/faculty/?expert=ray.toal) for programming languages ([ple GitHub repo](https://github.com/rtoal/ple)) and worked on AI behavior for a social-deception game called [Synthergy](https://www.synthergy.us/about). My interests include sustainable technology, aquaculture, and agriculture.
